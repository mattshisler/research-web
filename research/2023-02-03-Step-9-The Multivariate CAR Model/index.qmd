## Intro

Here we will extend the univariate CAR model to the multivariate case. 

Consider a spatial domain $\mathcal{D} \in \mathbb{R}^2$ that is partitioned into $n$ areal units. In the univariate case we specified a spatial random effect $\boldsymbol\phi = (\phi_1,\dots,\phi_n)$ meant to capture the spatial dependence. In the multivariate case we specify a spatial random vector $\boldsymbol\phi^T = (\boldsymbol\phi_1, \boldsymbol\phi_2,\dots,\boldsymbol\phi_3)$ where each $\boldsymbol\phi_i = (\phi_{i1}, \phi_{i2},\dots, \phi_{ip})$ is $p \times 1$.

The joint distribution of $\boldsymbol\phi_i$ is derived from the full conditional distributions.
Under the Markov Random Field (MRF) assumption, the conditional distributions can be specified as
$$
p(\boldsymbol\phi_i|\boldsymbol\phi_{j\ne i}, \Gamma_i) = N\left(\sum_{i \sim j} \mathbf{B}_{ij}\boldsymbol\phi_j, \Gamma_i\right), \quad i,j = 1,\dots,n.
$$

where $\Gamma_i$ and $\mathbf{B}_{ij}$ are $p \times p$ matrices.

Recall the role of $\Gamma_i$ and $\mathbf{B}_{ij}$. The former is...





Specifying the conditional distributions in this way implies the unique joint distribution, via Brook's Lemma, to be
$$
p(\boldsymbol\phi \;| \;\{\Gamma_i\}) \propto \exp\left\{-\frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol\phi^T\Gamma^{-1}(\mathbf{I} - \tilde{\mathbf{B}})\phi\right\}
$$
where $\Gamma$ is block-diagonal with block $\Gamma_i$, and $\tilde{\mathbf{B}}$ is $np \times np$ with the $(i,j)$-th block $\mathbf{B}_{ij}$.

This is a test push from macbook pro.
